            <h1 class="titleInovation">About offside technology</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
            FIFA has announced that semi-automated offside technology will be used at the FIFA World Cup 2022™ in Qatar
            starting on 21 November, offering a support tool for the video match officials and the on-field officials to
            help them make faster, more accurate and more reproducible offside decisions on the biggest stage of all.
            Following the successful use of VAR technology at the 2018 FIFA World Cup™ in Russia, FIFA President Gianni
            Infantino declared in The Vision 2020-23 that FIFA would strive to harness the full potential of technology
            in football and further enhance VAR. In the ensuing three years, FIFA has indeed continued to be at the
            cutting edge of technology in the game.
            UEFA chief refereeing officer Roberto Rosetti vowed that it will ‘enhance the flow of the game and the
            consistency of the decisions.’
            That will be done by having specialised cameras that track up to 29 different body parts on each player, and
            12 cameras underneath the roof of the stadium that track the ball.
            The position of each player is tracked 50 times per second to work out their exact position on the pitch at
            any given moment.
            This should happen ‘within a few seconds’, according to FIFA, leading to quicker offside calls.
            Once the on-field referee has confirmed the decision, the data points used for the decision will generate a
            3D animation that shows the position of the players’ limbs at the exact moment the ball was played.

        </header>
        <p>
            So, what problems did FIFA hope to solve?
            Firstly, selecting the exact point the ball is touched by the passer cannot be determined accurately because
            of the frame rate of TV cameras, 50 frames per second, used across all major leagues.
            Secondly, the VAR manually selects the furthest forward point on both defender and attacker, which cannot be
            applied consistently.
            AI removes all subjectivity from these two parts of the process, meaning there is no human role.
            Added to this, the time taken to judge offside, in some cases up to five minutes for complex decisions, adds
            further frustration.

            <h1 class="titleInovation">How it will work</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
            "We will implement in each World Cup stadium, 12 dedicated optical tracking cameras," Holzmuller said. "All
            these cameras are working together, and 100 percent synchronised. In addition to that, the official match
            ball will have a connected ball technology. A new Adidas suspension system houses a 500 hertz IMU [inertial
            measurement unit] sensor in the centre of the ball. We are combining the different data sets by applying
            Artificial Intelligence, and this automated alert is then appearing on a timeline inside the video
            operations room. This is happening immediately, within a few seconds. But then of course in addition there's
            the manual validation process by the video match officials to make sure that the data and everything is
            correct."

        </header>
        <p>
            “The objective is to have a very accurate technology, something similar to goal-line technology which offers
            a very high accuracy,” Collina explained. “The goal-line technology is praised by everybody for its
            accuracy. So if the ball did, or didn’t cross the goal line by very few millimetres, and the technology
            proves it, everyone is happy and everyone praises the technology for the very good answer provided.

        <p>
            “We have heard about robot referees and similar things,” Collina added. “I understand that sometimes this is
            very good for headlines, but this is not the case.
            “The match officials are still involved in the decision-making process, because the semi-automated offside
            gives an answer only when a player who was in an offside position plays the ball. In other words, the
            assessment of interfering with an opponent remains the match officials’ responsibility.”
            The semi-automated offside will also restore the joy of instant moments in football. VAR has been constantly
            criticized to have killed that humane aspect of the game. According to Chairman of the FIFA Referees
            Committee Pierluigi Collina, the semi-automated offside will give a decision within four to five seconds.
            “Semi-automated offside technology is an evolution of the VAR systems that have been implemented across the
            world. This technology is the culmination of three years of dedicated research and testing to provide the
            very best for the teams, players and fans who will be heading to Qatar later this year.

        </header>
        <p>
            “Goal-line technology clarifies black-and-white decisions as there is only the ball and the line, and for
            this reason it was quite easy to find a fully automated solution,” Collina said last year. “In an offside
            incident, the decision is taken after having analysed not only the position of players, but also their
            involvement in the play.
            “Technology, today or tomorrow, can draw a line but the assessment of interfering with play, or with an
            opponent, remains in referees’ hands. The involvement of the referees in the assessment of offside remains
            crucial and final.”
